variables:- A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program or else we can simply say variable is a container to store some data.
example:-->
name="Sipralin"
age=22
salary=23000.56
variable names -->name,age,salary
variable values -->"Sipralin",22,23000.56

Rules for Identifiers:-
1. Identifires -- names of the variable.
2. Identifires can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letter,digits or an underscore(_).  ex--myVariable,Variable 1.
3. An identifire can not start with digit.so while variable 1 is  valid but 1 variable is not valid.
4. We can not use the special character or symbols like !,#,@,%...etc.
5. Identifires can be any length.
6. Variables name should be small and meaningful like--when we give our age in that case we take the variable as"myAge".
myAge -->Camel case letter.


-->'type' is a operator to show the datatypes in our variabels like which datatypes we use  i our variables.

Data type:--

-->mainly data types are 5 type in python.
-->These data types are unmutable or build-in data type.
1. Integer --> +ve value,0,-ve value.
2. String--> "hello","Sipralin" etc...
3. Float --> 3.91,4.00,9.1 etc...
4. Boolean --> True , False
5. None --> not assaign


comments in python-->

-->when we write some code but we dont want to execute it then we give the comment line to that place so that line of code will not executed.
-->comments are 2 type..
1. Single line comment-->when we give the single line comments.in python we did it on"#".
example...
  # single line comment
  # this line comment
2. Multi line comment-->
when we give the multi line in comment in python we did it through """_""".
example-->
"""
multi line 
comments
""" 

Operator and Operands
Types of operator:-->

--Simple we can say operator is a symbol that performs a certain operation between operands.

example:--> a+b

a,b-->operands
+  -->operator

--There are 4 type of operators are present in python.
1. Arithmatic operator-->(+,-,*,/,%)
2. Relational operator-->(==,!=,>,<,>=,<=)
3. Assaignment  operator-->(=,+=,-=,/=,%=)
4. Logical operator-->(and,or,not)
    AND operator-->
     true + true = true
     true + false = false
     false + true = false
     false + false = false


Input in python-->
--Input statement is used to accept values (use keyboard) from users.
