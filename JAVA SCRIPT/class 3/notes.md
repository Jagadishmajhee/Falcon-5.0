Data types in Javascript :-

-Data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value.
-Mainly in Javascript there are 2 types of data type.
1.Primitive
2.Non-primitive

1.Primitive :-
-In javascript there are 7 types of primitive data types.
a.Number:   Contain numerical value.
b.String:   Can hold some characters like names
c:Boolean:    Boolean values like true,false
d.Undefined:  Here the data type is not defined so that it shows undefined
e.Null:     We get null for the value mean nothing
f.Symbol:   We get big integer 
g.BigInt    We get whole symbol as well as the value we get for the data type.


2.Non-primitive or Reference :-

-Can hold multiple items in a single time
-Non-primitive data types are - object, array, function

Object:-
-Object is a collection of (key:value) pairs.
-it can hold multiple of items in one single entity.
-The left hand side is our keys and right hand side are the values of the following objects. 
-Example:- let person = {
    name:"John",
    age:30,
    country:"USA"
    };



   -:OPERATORS:-

-Operators are the key features to do some task or operate some task.
-ex. A+B
-In the above example A & B are the operands, '+' is the operator to do the addition.
1. Arithmetic Operator:-
(+,-,*,/)
modulus  : %
Exponentiation : **
increament : ++
